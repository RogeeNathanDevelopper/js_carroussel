Responsive Dynamic Carousel
This project implements a responsive carousel with intelligent position management based on the number of elements. Whether the carousel contains an even or odd number of items, the project takes these specificities into account to ensure optimal display across all screen types.

Features
Responsive: The carousel automatically adjusts to the screen size, ensuring a smooth experience on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Dynamic position calculation: Carousel items are placed based on the total number of elements, whether it is even or odd. The carousel calculates and adjusts the positions to ensure that the items are correctly centered and aligned.
Supports even and odd carousels: The project handles carousels with either an even or odd number of items seamlessly, without the need for specific modifications.
Smooth navigation: Users can scroll through items using arrows or swipe gestures, with smooth animations.
Performance optimization: The carousel is designed to perform well even with a large number of items, minimizing recalculations during position changes.
